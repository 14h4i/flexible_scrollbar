# Foreword
A package has been designed to allow the creation of complex scroll bars. You can customize the scroll thumb, scroll line and add a label, that is positioned by the center of the scroll thumb by default, but you can customize its position as well. As those three things are created by builders called every time the scroll state is changed, you can add custom animations.

# How to use

The usage is as simple as a built-in Scrollbar, only you can customize it a lot more.

## Install

To install this package simple add the flexible_scrollbar to your dependencies in `pubspec.yaml`
